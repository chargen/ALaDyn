{"name":"ALaDyn","tagline":"3D electromagnetic Particle In Cell parallel code","body":"`ALaDyn` (**A**cceleration by **La**ser and **Dyn**amics of charged particles) is a PIC code firstly described in *ALaDyn: A High-Accuracy PIC code for the Maxwell-Vlasov Equations*, by C. Benedetti et al., published on IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, **36** 4, 1790-1798 (2008) and then again in the update *Charge preserving high order PIC schemes*, by P. Londrillo et al., published on Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A, **620** 1, 28-35 (2010). PWFA modules have been presented in *Numerical investigation of beam-driven PWFA in quasi-nonlinear regime*, by P. Londrillo et al., published on Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A, **740** (2014).\r\n\r\nThis newer version, in part rewritten from scratch, is released as an alpha version as is, without any warranty, and will be maintained here on GitHub. A new publication is currently underway to describe progresses on this new code. If you use `ALaDyn`, you're kindly required to cite the Zenodo DOI of the release you're using. You can find a usable DOI for each `ALaDyn` release.\r\n\r\nCopyright on the code is by P. Londrillo, A. Sgattoni, S. Sinigardi, A.
